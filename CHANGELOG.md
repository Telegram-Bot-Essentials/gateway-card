# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Until the API
stabilizes at 1.0 a `0.x` bump may carry breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Reworded the user-facing English and Persian strings to read more naturally; no keys or placeholders changed.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- Accepts essence 0.16 alongside 0.15.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- Requires essence `^0.15` for `adminAlert()`, `tbeLog()->audit()` and
  `tbeLog()->for()`.
- A bank SMS that cannot be auto-verified because no bank is chosen, or the
  billing currency is not IRR/IRT, now alerts the owner and admins (throttled)
  instead of being dropped with a debug or warning log nobody reads.
- An admin accepting or rejecting a card payment is an audit entry
  (`Accepted card payment #8 of 365000`).
- Log messages name the payment, invoice and amount they are about, and the
  SMS auto-verify entry is bound to the member who paid.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- The "check the amount and the card, and pay this exact amount"
  warning now shows on every card payment. Only the wallet-credit
  sentence stays conditional (an extra amount was added and the wallet
  is available).

## [0.1.13] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- `billing.gateways.card.unique_amount` is now a three-way setting:
  `hard` always adds a unique amount, `soft` (the default) only when
  another pending card payment already sits at that amount, `disabled`
  never does. A previously stored checkbox value is read as `hard` (on)
  or `disabled` (off).
- The unique amount is now picked from a coarse-to-fine ladder
  (1000, 500, 300, 200, 100, up to 5000) that no other pending payment
  on the bot uses, instead of a random 1-99. The old random offset only
  remains as a last resort when the whole ladder is taken.
- When `telegram-bot-essentials/user-wallet` is installed and enabled,
  the extra amount is credited to the member's wallet once the payment
  is confirmed (both auto-verify and manual admin accept). The wallet is
  optional (`suggest`); without it the extra amount is simply absorbed.
- The pay message warns to check the amount and the card and pay the
  exact amount, and mentions the wallet credit when one will happen.

### Changed

- The amount in the pay message keeps its thousands separators, with
  only the number inside the copyable `<code>` span.
- Card attempts are now closed explicitly (`cancelled` when the member
  backs out or the invoice is settled another way, `superseded` when a
  new attempt replaces it), so old attempts stop counting as pending
  payments. A migration backfills existing stale rows.

### Removed

- The random-retry `uniqueAmount()` helper, replaced by
  `UniqueAmountResolver`.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- 0.1.11's replay match crashed the member's own request right after
  they submitted payment proof (`BotStateAnswerHandled(): Argument #2
  ($state) must be of type string, null given`). `autoAccept()`
  unconditionally reapplied a `WebhookContext`, clearing and rebuilding
  the live request's context out from under it - including replacing
  the real incoming Telegram update with an empty one. Now only
  applied when not already running inside that exact context.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- SMS auto-verify only ever matched a pending card payment that already
  had proof submitted, so a bank deposit SMS arriving first - commonly
  faster than the member switching back to the bot - matched nothing
  and was gone for good. Unmatched SMS are now parked and replayed
  once proof lands, instead of only being logged.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Raised the `brick/math` floor to `0.14.2`: 0.1.9's fix used
  `RoundingMode::Down`, but that pascal-case name only exists from
  `0.14.2` onward (0.12.0-0.14.1 only had the upper-snake `DOWN`,
  removed entirely in 0.15) - a `--prefer-lowest` install could still
  resolve into the crash 0.1.9 meant to fix.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- SMS auto-verify crashed with "Undefined constant
  `Brick\Math\RoundingMode::DOWN`" on every incoming deposit SMS for
  IRT tenants - `brick/math` 0.12 replaced that constant with a native
  enum. Pinned to the enum-era range so this can't regress.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Auto-verify to-card payments from forwarded bank deposit SMS: a per-bot
  webhook (HMAC-signed, Blu Bank format to start) parses deposit
  notifications and auto-accepts the single pending attempt whose amount
  matches within a 30-minute window; an unmatched or ambiguous SMS falls
  back to the admin transactions chat for manual review.
- "Unique Payment Amounts" setting: adds a small random amount to each
  to-card invoice, retried against amounts already used by other pending
  attempts on the same bot, so concurrent payments of the same price can
  always be told apart automatically instead of colliding into manual
  review.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Accepts `telegram-bot-essentials/essence` `^0.14` as well as `^0.13`:
  0.14.0 only removed `DoneLimited`/`CannotSetItAsDone`/`HidesDone`, none of
  which this package uses.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- The manual card payment flow now shows the invoice amount and any offer
  code's effect: on the "pay to this card" message the member sees, and on
  the accept/reject message posted to the admin transactions chat (which
  previously carried no price at all).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** requires `telegram-bot-essentials/essence` `^0.12`.

### Added

- Pest test suite, Laravel Pint, Larastan (level max), GitHub Actions CI,
  Laravel Workbench, `LICENSE` (MIT) and this changelog.

### Removed

- The `phpstan-bootstrap.php` `ExceptionHandler` recursion stub — essence's
  handler now guards its own fallback path.
